  Install the Github Release binaries

author: hello@cloudposse.com

introduction: |-
  Fork of [jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release](https://github.com/jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release) 
  modified to install multiple releases at once and adopted to Cloud Posse's GitHub Actions standards.
  
  Define set of GH releases to install as `config` input following the format:
  
  * Short format: 
    ```yaml
      acme/repo-1: latest
    ```

    or 

    ```yaml
      acme/repo-1:
    ``` 
   
    which are equivalent
  * Long format:  

    ```yaml
    acme/repo-4:
      tag: v0.1.0
      platform: linux
      arch: amd64
      ## Seek for `(tar.gz|zip|tgz)` archived asset (default "extension")
      extension-matching: true
    ```
  
  Long format supports the following parameters:
  
  | Name | Description | Default |
  |------|-------------|---------|
  | tag | Tag containing binary to install | `latest` |
  | platform | OS Platform to match in release package | `{platform of current runner}` |
  | arch | OS Architecture to match in release package | `{arch of current runner}` |
  | extension-matching | Set `true` to match extension in release package | `false` |
  | extension | Extension match pattern | `tar.gz\|zip\|tgz` |
  | rename-to | When installing a release that is not an archive, e.g. a pure binary, this controls how the downloaded release asset is renamed. | `null` |
  | chmod | When installing a release that is not an archive, e.g. a pure binary, this controls how the downloaded release asset is chmod'd. | `null` |
